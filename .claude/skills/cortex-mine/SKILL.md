# Knowledge Cortex — Mine

Mine your Gmail history into structured flat files — contacts, clients, communications, and key facts — stored in `~/.cortex/`. No server required. Files you own.

## When invoked

Read `{skill_path}/references/file-schema.md` for the storage format before any file operations.

## Commands

| What user says | Action |
|----------------|--------|
| "run the cortex" / "cortex run" | Run mining pass |
| "cortex dry run" | Mine without writing — pass `--dry-run` |
| "cortex from DATE" | Mine from specific date — pass `--from YYYY-MM-DD` |
| "set up the cortex" | Run first-time setup |

## Setup (first run)

Check prerequisites:
```bash
which gws || echo "MISSING: npm install -g @googleworkspace/cli"
python3 -c "import anthropic" 2>/dev/null || echo "MISSING: pip install anthropic"
ls ~/.cortex/state.json 2>/dev/null || echo "FIRST RUN"
```

If `gws` missing: tell user `npm install -g @googleworkspace/cli` then `gws auth setup`.
If `anthropic` missing: tell user `pip install anthropic` (or `pip install anthropic --break-system-packages` on managed Python).
If first run: initialise storage.

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.cortex/originals
echo '{}' > ~/.cortex/contacts.json
echo '{}' > ~/.cortex/clients.json
touch ~/.cortex/communications.jsonl ~/.cortex/knowledge.jsonl ~/.cortex/files.jsonl
```

Write `~/.cortex/state.json`:
```json
{"version":"1.0","cursors":{"gmail":null},"last_run":null,"totals":{"contacts":0,"clients":0,"communications":0,"knowledge":0,"files":0},"runs":[]}
```

## Mining

```bash
python3 {skill_path}/scripts/cortex-mine.py
python3 {skill_path}/scripts/cortex-mine.py --dry-run
python3 {skill_path}/scripts/cortex-mine.py --from 2024-01-01
python3 {skill_path}/scripts/cortex-mine.py --batch-size 25
```

The script prints a run report on completion. Show it to the user verbatim.

**Common errors:**
- `gws: command not found` — install gws CLI
- `AuthError` / `403` — run `gws auth setup`
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY not set` — set env var or add to `~/.cortex/.env`
- `ModuleNotFoundError: anthropic` — `pip install anthropic`

## Scheduling

- Claude Code Desktop: Cowork > Scheduled > New Task > `Run the cortex-mine skill` > Daily
- CLI: `/loop 24h run the cortex-mine skill`
- Cron: `0 6 * * * cd ~ && ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-... python3 /path/to/cortex-mine.py`

## Exporting data

See `{skill_path}/references/export-adapters.md` for patterns to export cortex data to Obsidian, SQLite, Notion, CRM systems, or custom APIs.

## Environment

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `CORTEX_DIR` | `~/.cortex` | Storage root |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | — | Required for extraction |
| `CORTEX_BATCH_SIZE` | `50` | Threads per run |
| `CORTEX_OWNER_EMAIL` | — | Your email — excluded from contacts |
